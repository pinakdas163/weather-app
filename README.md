# Simple Weather App

This is a simple weather app project built using Vuetify 3, Vue 3, and Vite. It uses the OpenWeatherMap API to fetch weather data for a given city. The app allows users to search for a city and view the weather conditions, temperature, and humidity for the next 5 hours and 5 days.
